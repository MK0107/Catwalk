# Catwalk

  Catwalk is a E-commerce website built with React Native that can digest 1M users per minute with outstanding performance that shoulders standard for a legacy website.
  It displays products with review, rating, related products, and Q&A with strong backbone of PostgreSQL database management system.
  
## Installation

  Use the package manager 'npm' to install dependencies and run scripts to start server and webpack.

```bash
npm install
npm run express-dev
npm run react-dev
```

## Usage

  Catwalk was a client request based re-design of database and UI/UX project and its usage was to showcase the ability 
  as software engineers that the team was promising, agile, and creative on our final delivery and prove the persistency of back-end system
  with stress tests assimilated with K6 and later optimization of all the queries made to the system accordingly.
